# 7 Critical Reasons Why Your Business Must Be Separate From You

### Quick questions

- Why do the businesses run by rich men seem to go on smoothly while they go on vacations?
- What is the secret for getting all the government contracts, grants and bank loans?
- Why do businesses last decades and centuries?

The truth is – there is no simple answer. But this four-minute read will give you an insight into what you must do to achieve a running business with or without your physical presence.

## What Does it Mean For Your Business to be Separate?

### Explaining Legal Personality

The concept of separation of business was designed to give a legal structure and recognition to a business. For instance, in Nigeria, a business can be recognised under the law as a separate entity from its owners and capable of owning properties in its own name, signing contracts, sue and be sued in its name and surviving the death or withdrawal of any of its owners. The separation of a business from its owners is known as the incorporation (otherwise known as registration) of that company and can be likened to the birth of a natural person[^1].

Upon incorporation, the business attains a legal or corporate personality and considered as an artificial person in the eyes of the law capable of having rights and performing some duties in its own name.

## Why Your Business Needs a Legal Personality

### 1. Limited Liability

One of the most important reasons people incorporate a company is to restrict the liability they will incur in the event there is a liability resulting from either a breach of contract, debt crisis and so on. There is also limitation of liability if the company is to be liquidated and wound up (i.e. complete closure of the company).

For example:

A, B and C incorporate a company called Vero Haulage Limited and their individual total shares is worth N10, N20 and N50 respectively. In the company’s name, a contract was duly entered into with Anger Nigeria Plc while they also took a loan from Giveaway bank Plc.

If the contract was breached by Vero Haulage Limited and also unable to pay the loan due to honest reasons, the owners – A, B and C would only be liable to contribute N10, N20 and N50 respectively to pay the company’s debt. This means that their personal assets cannot be sold to satisfy the company’s debt since the company is seen as a different legal personality.

### 2. Tax Benefits

There are categories of tax benefits that only a company can enjoy. For instance, pioneer companies (companies involved in specified industrial activities e.g. fertilizer production, glassware manufacturing) and export oriented companies are entitled to tax holidays. Companies involved in agricultural production are also exempt from income tax for five years[^2].

### 3. Funding and Investment

There is no easier and more secure way to raise funds for a business better than when it is incorporated. When a business is incorporated as a company, funds may then be raised through debt or equity.

A debt may simply be described as a loan to the company from individual or institutional lenders e.g. banks. On the other hand, equity funding is selling the company’s shares in return for capital (funds, real estate, intellectual property, expertise).

Also, companies are better trusted and eligible for government funding through grants or low-interest loans and grants from other international agencies. Lastly, in the corporate world, a company is a better machinery to be trusted when bidding for contracts as opposed to a sole proprietorship or partnerships with registered business names.

### 4. Continuity of Business

Another important characteristic of incorporation is that the business now has a life of its own and can outlive any or all of its owners. This explains why some companies have lasted tens and hundreds of years.

Do you want to leave a business legacy? Incorporating a company is the way to go.

### 5. Corporate Personality

Although explained earlier, corporate personality also refers to legal personality. The advantages of incorporating your company (by giving it a corporate personality) include:

- Capacity to own both real, personal and intellectual assets
- Capacity to sue and be sued in its own name
- Capacity to employ its own management (Board of Directors) and staff
- Capacity to borrow or lend in its own name

### 6. Finances

One other advantage of incorporating a company is that the company is now capable of running its own finances separately from your personal account. A corporate account can be opened with any bank of your choice in the name of the company. This allows for proper accounting records and audit.

### 7. Easy Valuation & Transfer of Ownership

A sole proprietorship is usually difficult to evaluate because of the mix between the business and its owner. However, a company has a distinct value, its own assets and debts. Therefore, it is easy to value the worth of your business annually.

In addition to this, you can sell your stake in the business easily and the company can continue without your physical input. A company is usually sold when the shares belonging to the majority shareholder is sold

As you would see above, there are a lot of benefits for incorporation. Get in touch with a small business lawyer or corporate attorney in Lagos (Nigeria) to incorporate your company.
