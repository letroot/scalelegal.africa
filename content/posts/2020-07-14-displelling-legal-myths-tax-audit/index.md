# Dispelling Legal Myths Around Tax and Audit

We understand that you want to keep a low profile (from government agencies; shhhh) after registering your business or incorporating a company.

But you have probably heard (rumours) about tax and audit that you must comply with.
The truth is… you cannot run away from tax and audit of your business if you are planning for the long haul. Rather, what you can do is to face it and understand how the system works. From there, you can easily navigate the turbulent waters of government and business without evasion of tax or non-compliance, and still keep a low profile or maybe then, a great public profile.

The question is HOW? And that’s why Scale Legal Africa is here to help you with this short article that will put your mind at ease.

## Tax for Business Names
Registered business names are required to pay at least the following taxes:
### Personal Income Tax

#### Tax for Owners/Partners of Business Names
A business name is not recognised as a separate entity aside from the owner(s) in law. This means that the business, unlike a company, is not taxed separately from the proprietor(s) or partners. Instead, the profit which is shared between the partners or solely owned in the case of a sole proprietorship is what is taxed under the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA).

If Yahaya and Ada begin a consulting business and after a financial year, a profit of N1 million naira is made after deducting all expenses (tax deductibles) and operating cost, and the N1 million naira is shared in a 50-30 percentage formula, while 20% is retained for business expansion. Yahaya’s N500,000 and Ada’s N300,000 would be taxed accordingly under Personal Income Tax (PIT). 

Please note that there is no fixed percentage of tax to be remitted on either salaries or profits of owners. It is calculated on a progressive scale i.e. the more you earn, the more tax you pay.

The PIT is to be remitted to the state government where they carry on business.

#### Tax on Employees
Under the tax administration regime in Nigeria, the management of a business is expected to deduct tax at source on the salaries or wages of employees or any person on the payroll of the business. This is known as the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAY-E) system. The percentage to be deducted is also calculated under a graduated scale as provided under the PITA.

## Tax for Companies

### Company Income Tax (CIT)
There is usually the fear that incorporating a company involves paying huge taxes. Nothing can be further from the truth. The wealthy people know this and use the incorporation of companies to their advantage.

Previously, all companies were required to pay 30% on all their taxable income in a year of assessment. (Emphasis on “companies” and “taxable profits” as the shareholders/owners or directors are not taxed directly but rather the profits on the income of the company. Please note that not all the income of a company is taxable).

With the amendment of the Company Income Tax Act by the Finance Act 2019, the tax payable has been staggered as follows:

- Companies with turnover less than N25,000,000 (Twenty-Five Million Naira) — Exempted from CIT
- Companies with turnover of N25,000,000 (Twenty-Five Million Naira) but less than N100,000,000 (One Hundred Million Naira) — 20% of taxable income.
- Companies with turnover above N100,000,000 (One Hundred Million Naira) — 30% of taxable income.

The Company Income Tax is payable to the Federal Government through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The CIT can be paid in installments before the due date and does not have to be paid as a lump sum provided the consent of the FIRS.

### Other Company Taxes
A company is expected to pay the following taxes in addition to CIT:

#### Education Tax
A company is expected to pay **2%** of its yearly assessable profits as tertiary education tax to the FIRS. This can be paid alongside the CIT. However, it is advisable to deduct the tertiary education tax before calculating the CIT as education tax is treated as an allowable deduction on taxable income.

#### Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT)
For companies engaged in **upstream petroleum**, they are required to pay the PPT instead of the CIT. Please note that NOT all companies are required to pay PPT.

#### Pay-As-You-Earn for Employees
Please see above under the Personal Income Tax

## Tax for Companies
The following are other taxes a company or business name is required to pay in carrying on its business:

### Value Added Tax (VAT)
The new VAT rate for goods and services sold or rendered by a company or business has been revised **from 5% to 7.5%** of the value of such goods and services.

Please note that all businesses and companies that earn a gross annual turnover of N25,000,000 (Twenty-Five Million Naira) or more are mandated to register for tax under the Value Added Tax Act as amended. VAT returns are to be made by this category of businesses on or before the 21st of every month.

However, to promote the ease of doing business, the government has granted relief from paying VAT to businesses and companies that earn less than N25,000,000 (Twenty-Five Million Naira).

### Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
Under the Capital Gains Tax Act, tax is chargeable from proceeds realised from the sale of certain assets (lands, buildings, machinery are considered qualifying assets). This tax rate is fixed at 10% of the profits made on the asset disposal. Not all disposals of assets are chargeable under CGT. There are also allowable expenses before calculating your CGT such as advertising fees or professional fees incurred in the disposal.

The CGT is also paid to the FIRS.

### Withholding Tax
This is an indirect form of taxation imposed on specified transactions in business. A business is required to deduct a specified tax rate (usually 10% or 7.5% or 5%) on transactions involving individuals or companies. Please contact a tax lawyer or tax expert for more advice on the subject.

## Tax Reliefs and Credit

* Companies involved in the agricultural business are given tax reliefs for up to five years from the commencement of business.
* Small companies are no longer required to pay minimum tax.

## Online Tax Payment
The good news is that tax filings and payments can be made via the FIRS e-payment portal for businesses and companies alike. With a Tax Identification Number, businesses in Nigeria can register an account with the FIRS and pay their taxes as smoothly as imagined.

## What is a Tax Clearance Certificate? (TCC)
A tax clearance certificate is an official document from a tax administration authority that the business or company has no outstanding tax to be paid. It is very crucial for individuals, businesses and companies to obtain their TCC as they may not be able to bid for certain projects (especially government or international) without a TCC. 

Please contact an experienced tax lawyer in Nigeria or near you to obtain your TCC without hassles.

## AUDIT
At the mention of the word, many people are often scared. This is why you deserve a competent legal consultant to properly advise you through the process of appointing auditors for the company and the right procedures in the process to avoid government sanctions or business pitfalls.

An audit is an external inspection into the financial statements and accounts of a company.

### Appointing Auditors
A company is required to appoint an auditor (which can also be a firm of auditors) at every annual general meeting. However, the first auditors can be appointed at the meeting of the board of directors preceding the first Annual General Meeting.

According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants Act 1965, the following cannot be appointed as company auditors:
(a.) an officer or servant of the company; 
(b.) a person who is a partner of or in the employment of an officer or servant of the company; 
(c.) a body corporate, 
(d.) in the decree wherever the word "accountant" appears there shall be substituted the words "chartered accountant".

Please note that there are other laws that regulate the appointment of auditors in certain industries e.g. banking.
