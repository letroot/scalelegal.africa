# The Simple Legal Steps to Incorporating Your Business The Right Way

Oftentimes, company registration that is the incorporation of one's business is often shrouded with complexity and lack of transparency that keeps the entrepreneur/business owner in the dark and leaves him feeling insecure about the entire process.

There is a need to be informed about the details that go into this really important aspect of the business journey in a manner that is simple and that ensures you are getting the best possible services in this regard.

We would explain this with the story of two female entrepreneurs: Chioma and Zainab, one operating in the East and the other in the West of Nigeria

Both are carrying out business in the agric technology space and have a passion for business growth in order to transform the communities where their businesses operate.

Aware of investment opportunities that can be harnessed in their industry, they made a smart move to choose an incorporated business over a mere business registration (Find the benefits in our article here).

Chioma, being mindful of cost, got the services of an inexperienced startup lawyer whilst Zainab was more particular about the prospect of her business and therefore sought the help of a professional startup lawyer who can plan with her long term.

The actions taken in the incorporation of their business though follow the same steps yet have very vital differences that will count in the long run for the growth of their business as you will find below:
Requirement for Incorporation
Choosing the type of Company to Incorporate
Filling up Forms
Preparation of Incorporation Documents
Name Reservation, Filing Fees and Stamp Duties

From the above, it is readily seen that the most vital part of incorporating a business is getting proper advice from an experienced startup lawyer who can offer you services tailored to the need of your business and the future you envisage for her.
