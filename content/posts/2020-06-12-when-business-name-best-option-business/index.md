# When Business Name Registration is the Best Option for Your Business

Sometimes, it can be confusing for business owners to decide which best business structure to register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). You are right to want your business registered with the CAC but there are different forms of registration with the CAC and whichever corporate structure you register would prove vital to how much you can accomplish in the business world.

Here is a simple guide for you to decide if your business is best suited for business name registration[^1].

## Small Growing Business or Trade

Registration of business names is usually the most preferable destinations for small businesses that are in their early stages (e.g. bakers, salons, IG stores) or sole proprietorships.

For instance, Instagram store owners and bakers can register their business names with the CAC for the sake of credibility and some other cool benefits that come alongside. Registering a business name is usually the best option when the owner wants to keep the business close and plans to secure the name before another business registers the name.

## Cooperative Societies

Under the Nigerian law, cooperative societies can have their business names registered after seeking the approval of the Registrar of Business Names[^2]. As such, cooperative societies have the opportunity to formalise their association by registering their business name with the CAC.

## Prefer Less Formalities

The forms of registration of businesses with the CAC include:

- Incorporation of a Private, Public or Unlimited Company
- Registration of a Business Name
- Incorporation of Associations

Of all the above types of registrations, the simplest to register and one that requires the least formalities is the registration of a business name. It is also the one that has the least regulatory oversight from government agencies. Therefore, there are fewer requirements to keep the business running yearly. For instance, there are no requirements to hold an Annual General Meetings, keep accounting records, appoint a company secretary, etc.

Speak to a small business lawyer to know the obligations a registered business name must fulfill every year and avoid penalties or cancellation.

## Side Hustle

For different reasons, many corporate workers engage in economic activities (otherwise known as “Side Hustles”) other than their contractual work. For the purpose of maintaining a low profile, registering a business name is a sound idea. With a registered name, they can secure the uniqueness of their brand names and avoid breaching contractual terms that prohibits them from joining the formation of a company or being a director elsewhere.

## Time-Bound Partnership

Business partnerships are strategic roadmaps to success in the corporate world. To provide a formal platform or these partnerships, registration of business name can be a suitable option especially if it is a temporary or fixed-time partnership.

For example, if Limpopo makes shoes in Ibadan and he wants to expand his business to Lagos. He needs a steady supply line to his customers in Lagos for cheaper rates. There, he meets with his old friend, Okey Bassey who runs a hailing delivery service and together they form a partnership. This partnership can be registered as a business name which will gain customers’ confidence.

## Benefits of a Registered Business Name

A registered business name has the following advantages:

1. Security over the registered name to prevent brand identity theft
2. Registration of a corporate account
3. Eligibility for certain government and international grants
4. Boosts customer confidence
5. Better leverage for business loans
6. Creation of a brand identity

**NB:** It should be noted that not having enough money to fund the incorporation of a company is not a good reason to opt for a business name ahead of the incorporation of a company.
