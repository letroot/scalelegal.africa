# Incorporating a Company in Nigeria – The Basics that You Need to Know

Whenever two or more people want to formalise their business operations in such a manner as to give the business a separate life of its own, the usual legal prescription is to incorporate a company.

Take our scenario as an example:

Herbert is a Computer Engineer in Lagos with at least three years of experience in purchasing, installing and repairing computer systems for Computer Based Technology (CBT) Centres in Nigeria.

His close friend, Emeka, works with his uncle at his importation business. The uncle’s business is involved in importing all kinds of vehicle spare parts and computers. As such, during one of their run-ins, they agree to have a business meeting to discuss a company they could own.

While thinking about the possibility of breaking into the market, Herbert considers that the prospective business will need a skilled marketer. So, he calls up Kingsley, a marketing and content writing start-up owner in Lagos to be part of the discussions.

At the business lunch/meeting, they all agreed to form a new company and fancied the idea of being directors. However, Kingsley is insistent that he will only be part of the arrangement through his company and that his company will not shut down its business operations because of the new venture.

Herbert wonders if Kingsley’s condition is admissible and does the right thing by calling a CAC accredited lawyer[^1] to assist them with the perspective on Nigeria’s company law.

Here are the lawyer’s submissions:

### 1. Involvement of a Company in the formation of a new company

A company is regarded in law as a juristic entity with a legal personality of its own. Hence, it can do in law, most of the things natural persons can do. A company is in fact, referred to as an artificial person.

Kingsley’s marketing and content writing company can be part of the incorporation of the new company. The company can do this by way of resolution, agreeing to subscribe to the formation of the new company.

### 2. Requirements for Incorporation

#### a. Membership

The minimum requirement for the incorporation of a company is two subscribers to the Memorandum of Association[^2]. These subscribers would later become the shareholders/members of the company upon incorporation.

They must be 18 years or above (if they are natural persons) and a minor is not allowed to join in the formation unless there are already two qualified subscribers[^3].

#### b. Registered Principal Address

There must be a principal address for their business operations. This can be a home or shared office if they are yet to acquire a place for business.

#### c. First Directors

The directors of a company are different from its members. Directors represent the decision-making part of the company.

The law requires for a prospective company to have at least two qualified persons as the first directors[^4].

If a company (Company K) is involved in the incorporation of another company (Company HEK), then Company K can appoint a director in its own company to be a first director in Company HEK by way of resolution.

### 3. Form and Type of Company

There are three major forms of company in Nigeria:

- Limited by Shares
- Limited by Guarantee
- Unlimited Companies

A private or public company may be registered under the above categories (there are some exceptions e.g. public company limited by guarantee is not acceptable).

Thus, there are four types of companies you can incorporate in Nigeria under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), namely:

1. Private Company Limited by Shares
2. Public Company Limited by Shares
3. Private Company Limited by Guarantee
4. Unlimited Companies

The most common and easiest type of company to incorporate is the private company limited by shares. Each subscriber will have a specified shareholding in the company and a shareholding formula will be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.

The minimum authorised share capital is N10,000.00 (Ten Thousand Naira) for a private company and N500,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand Naira) for a public company. This is required to be paid up at the incorporation of the company[^5].

Share capital refers to the contribution (capital) of the subscribers/members to the company. While a minimum is required to be paid up at the time of incorporation, the subscribers may pledge to contribute more.

A subscriber may also contribute other things in the stead of monetary contributions such as land, intellectual property, fixed assets, etc. However, these assets will have to be valued in monetary terms to be registered.

It is important to note that the more the capital a subscriber pledges at the formation of a company, the more the liability he or she would incur peradventure the company becomes insolvent.

### 4. Filling of Forms, Other Documents and Legal Attestation

All the subscribers must fill the registration forms and the first directors. They must also complete their Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association which will be submitted alongside the incorporation forms.

Other documents like the shareholders’ Agreement (if any) and a Joint Venture Agreement (if any) should be submitted.

For the application forms to be accepted for incorporation in Nigeria, **a legal practitioner must attest** to the documents being submitted that they are in order even if you are able to register the company yourself.

### 5. Reservation of Name, Filing Fees and Stamp Duties

To commence the process, your CAC accredited agent or lawyer must log into his account on the CAC portal to reserve your choice of company name. If there are no conflicts in the name chosen and it is accepted, the agent will proceed to file the incorporation documents and pay the necessary filing fees to CAC and stamp duties to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.

There are many benefits of incorporating a company which is discussed in our next post –Benefits of Incorporating Your Dream Company.

As you have seen above, incorporating a company can be a bit tedious but ultimately a mission that is possible. Luckily, if you speak to the right CAC accredited lawyer or agent; you can have it easy-peasy. Talk to a legal consultant today.
