# The Ideal Company Secretary for Fast-Growing Businesses in Nigeria

Just before you start up or upgrade your company…

Have you asked who should be your company secretary and your best choice?

> “One of the most vital choices business owners can make for the growth of their company is that of the company secretary.”

A company secretary is an office function within a company and is charged with the responsibility of carrying out the mandate of the company and its Board of Directors. The company secretary is also the middleman between the company and regulatory bodies as well as third parties. You can read our post on *“Duties of an Ideal Company Secretary”*.

The highlight of this short article is to explain the criteria for choosing the ideal secretary for your company.

## What Does the Law Say About Secretaries of the Company?

### Private Companies
Unlike public companies, there are no additional requirements or specifications under the Companies & Allied Matters Act for private companies on who can be appointed as a company secretary.

What is only required to be considered in the appointment of a private company secretary is that the director/board of directors have resolved that the appointee is a person who appears to him/them to have the requisite knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of a secretary of a company. In other words, the appointee is qualified enough in their assessment to be a company secretary.

#### Who should be the Private or Public Company Secretary?
If your company is about to decide who should be the company secretary, the following factors into consideration (irrespective of the type of company you are incorporating):

##### Secretariat Skills
A company secretary is the manager of your company’s secretariat. The secretary is to keep the official registers and records of the company and properly document official interactions between the company and the government or third-party entities. The minutes of the meetings held by the company and board of directors are also documented by the secretary as well as preparation and execution of company resolutions.

##### Knowledge of the Law and Compliance
Without the knowledge of the law and how it affects your business, a company secretary is as good as non-existent (except you have an in-house legal team) and the repercussions would bring untold hardship for the company. A company secretary must be well abreast of legal developments and ensure the company is in full compliance.

##### Understands Your Business/Industry Knowledge
It is crucial for the company secretary to be able to navigate the industry in which your business operates. This is important because it is not enough to know the law but also to apply it in context of each business to drive growth and expansion.

##### Execution per Excellence
One of the core characteristics of an ideal company secretary is the ability to carry out the mandate of the company and resolutions of the Board of Directors in a manner that matches international practice standards.

#### When Can You Appoint a Company Secretary?
A company secretary can be appointed at the following stages:<br>

a. During the incorporation of the company (Filing of Form CAC 1.1)<br>
b. Post-Incorporation
