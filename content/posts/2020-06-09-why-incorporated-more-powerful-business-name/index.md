# When Business Name Registration is the Best Option for Your Business

Any serious-minded entrepreneur takes the need for a business structure quite seriously because of the long term implication of it to business profitability and success. Usually, there seems to be a common challenge faced by entrepreneurs in Nigeria in deciding between Company Registration and Business Name Registration.

There are pros and cons of either of these options that must be clearly explored before an informed decision can be taken by a business owner or prospective one.

To simplify these options available to the business owner, we would take the story of Global Trading Enterprises and Invention Technologies Ltd started by Henry and Bernard respectively.

Both are graduates of the University of Lagos with big entrepreneurial dreams in the emerging technology space.

Henry is very driven and starts out with an e-commerce business building a website that allows ...to be undertaken by traders. He proved his business model and started making quite some money in a short while. Seeing the need to advance his business, he needed legal structure and hurriedly rushed off into getting a Business Registration done by himself believing it would help save time and money.

Then, there is Bernard. He equally believed in the prospects of e-commerce in Nigeria and the role of logistics in realising this. Bernard decided to go into e-commerce and logistics side by side. He got a startup lawyer, was advised to register a company and position his business for possible funding and opportunities that will exist in this space.

After about a year and some months, the implication of their differing actions begins to materialise. The difference became obvious in the following regards:

## 1. Separate Legal Entity

The error of Henry first becomes visible in this regard. When a foremost bank in the country was seeking a corporate partner to drive the eCommerce project being offered to SMEs on their platform, Bernard’s company was chosen for the sole reason of its corporate structure which assures the Bank of the sustainability of the business.

The issue of a separate legal entity implies that the company is a different person from its owners such that the personal life and account of the owners are separate from its books. The Bank was confident that an issue with Bernard will not translate to that of his company since the company was separate from him.

## 2. Limited Liability

When Henry lost a deal due to a certain flood where both his company and Bernard’s are located, he ran into debts due to the expenses made ahead in hopes of that deal. He had it sell off certain properties owned by his business. But since that could not cover-up, he had to sell his car. He was personally liable for the debts of the business because he did not incorporate his business.

Whilst Bernard’s company did incur some debts, he was personally liable for them and the debts were paid overtime strictly from the company's coffers.

## 3. Onboarding Investors/ Issuing Equity

Both Henry and Bernard are informed of a rare “Pitch For Tech” event where they can raise money from investors as they pitch their startup and its vision to them. The two entrepreneurs impressed investors but it was a disgraceful surprise for the investors to find that Henry did not have a structure that could allow them to pick up equity in the company. This seemingly simple issue was regarded as evidence as to negligence that may depict a possible habit of the said entrepreneur.

Needless to say, Bernard onboarded investors and issued equity from the reserved unissued shares as he had been rightly advised by his lawyer.

## 4. Getting Loans

Henry, in need of funds, had further trouble getting loans as his creditworthiness was downed by the lack of a board that can allow for an accountable company and a structure that is well regulated for the kind of loans that he sought to get.

## 5. Hiring Technical Partners

Bernard was able to hire and retain very experienced and skilled technical partners into his company than Henry because he was able to woo them through shares vested in them over a minimum four year period, as advised by his corporate lawyer. Henry suffered from a far less skilled technical manpower since the brightest minds were not willing to work for no incentives. His top employees were far less incentivised since they did not have a sense of ownership in the business like Bernard’s employees.

## 6. Implication on Finances

One important and notable difference that Bernard and Henry’s businesses have is in how their finances are managed and it is largely due to the structure of the business that they operate. Where one has to maintain regular auditing and a transparent book which tends to encourage investment, the other has loose accounts due to the little need for accountability.

The higher demand to ensure accountability can come off as a disadvantage but in the long run, choosing an enterprise structure is far more profitable to the owners and the health of the business.

The difference between a business name and a registered company has been highlighted above. A question that comes to mind is “what if I have registered a business name? Can I convert it to a registered company?” The simple answer is yes. However, this is a cumbersome process that may end up impossible to accomplish if certain requirements are not met. This is why we generally advise entrepreneurs to register their business as a Company from the get-go.
